# SmartWindow
SmartWindow is a IoT-project originating in CMPSC 293S Internet of Things, a class about networks held at UCSB during winter 2019. The team consisted of students: Fredrik Sørmo, Cecilia Peinert, Lars Møster, and Silje Tyrihjell. Our project goal was to create an end-to-end IoT product which allows users to predict the level of air pollution outside a window, with the conceptual use case of suggesting to inhabitants when best to open and close the window to minimize polluted air. The product consists of a SDS011 Dust Sensor, measuring concentrations of particles PM10 and PM2.5, connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero, which continuously uploads data to Amazon Web Service IoT Core.  These measurements could be combined with external data gathered from publicly available APIs to forecast pollution levels for the next seven days. Weather, i.e.: humidity, wind-speed, temperature, and precipitation was gathered from HERE.com, and Wunderground, allowing for on demand forecasting. Day-of-week was added as a factor, as it impacts pollution levels caused by traffic [1]. Machine learning, using a Keras - TensorFlow - Flask setup for Python, was used to develop the model with which forecasting was done. The model was trained on pollution and weather data from 2017 and 2018, which provided reasonably accurate predictions considering the project scope, however they tended to be overly conservative.
